### 🔖 Core Philosophical Commitments
### 🪀 Low Fidelity Models
1. Interpretiblity above all else.
2. Simplicity and parsimony (KISS)
3. Physics first, data second.
4. Sing-develepor feasibility
5. Aesthetically cohererent, publishable, and portfolio-friendly
6. No content for content's sake (save that for Zettelkasten)


### 🪩 High Fidelity Models
1. Low fidelity core commitments
2. Scalable
3. Practical
   - scientific value
   - computationally efficient
4. Explicit Symmetry Encoding

### 🏡 Take-Home Messages:
> Physics residual minimization does got guarantee physical inveriants unless sampling resolves the solution spectrum. This is a manifestation of **spectral bias**.

> Residual minimization approximates the operator constraint, but conservation emerges from the generator s tructure. If the generator isnt structurally preserved (via sampling or architecture), invariants drift even under converged optimization.
> - This connects spectral bias in neural nets to...
>    - Nyquist sampling theory
>    - Hamiltonian structure
>    - Conservation Laws
>    - PINN failure modes
